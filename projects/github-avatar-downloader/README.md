# GitHub Avatar Downloader

## Problem Statement

Given a GitHub repository name and owner, download all the contributors' profile images and save them to a subdirectory, `avatars/`.

## Expected Usage

This program should be executed from the command line, in the following manner:

`node download_avatars.js jquery jquery`

... (whatever else you'd like to include)


In this activity, you will partially implement a single function called getRepoContributors. Using the request package, you will fetch the list of contributors as a JSON string from the GitHub API's contributors endpoint. Upon receiving the results, your function will invoke a callback function with the results. This callback function will loop over and print out the avatar_url for each object in the collection.
